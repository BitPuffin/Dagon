Dagon
=====

My personal fork of the HPL1 Engine by Frictional Games. I am planning to upgrade it quite a bit and
use it for my own project. In order to stay true to the original engine honoring Howard Phillips Lovecraft
I decided to name my version of the engine "Dagon" after one of his short stories (one of my favorites).

Things I plan to change/add:

+ Built in level editor
+ Geometry processing fitting for reasistic outdoor environments
+ Make the engine more scriptable
+ Erosion
+ Dynamic Ambient Occlusion
+ Indirect Lighting
+ Deferred Shading
+ FXAA
+ Crepuscular and Anti-Crepuscular rays
+ Undergrowth
+ Volumetric Lighting

I hope to remain backwards compatible if possible, so you can play Penumbra with deluxe graphics!
